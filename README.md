# Mac Development Setup

This is my automated setup for most of the software I use on my Mac for development.  The purpose of this is to keep an ongoing list of what I am using in my environment and to have an automated way to rebuild it in case I ever need to.  If you find the software list below useful, then please use this as it could save you a few hours vs doing it manually yourself.  It is also customizable with its own configuration if you want to modify which software/programs get installed on your machine as well. 

## Installation

1. ensure you have `python3` and `pip` installed.  You typically do if you have a late-ish MacOS ( El Capitan and above ).
2. Create a virtual environment and install ansible in it - for this example, lets just create the virtualenv in our `$HOME`

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/venvs/mac_ansible
source ~/venvs/mac_ansible/bin/activate
pip3 install ansible
```

3. Run the playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-become-pass

```

4. Provide the sudo passwords when it asks
5. ...
6. Profit

Programs (installed with Homebrew):
  - vim

  - wget
  - htop
  - nmap
  - sqlite
  - go
  - node

Dotfiles:

It installs all the dotfiles from my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nickmaccarthy/dotfiles) repo.  If you have your own dotfiles you want to use instead, simply set your `dotfiles_items` and or your own `dotfiles_repo` in a `custom.config.yml` and this will take care of that for you.   

## Overriding Default Application / Programs

You may want to customize which applications and or programs that get installed through Brew / Cask / Pip etc.  Its easy to do, simply create a file called `custom.config.yml` (included in this repo) and place it in the root of this directory (same directory that `playbook.yml` and this `README` is in), and then add your own items.

Example `custom.config.yml`:

```yaml
# Install my .dotfiles from my repo here: https://github.com/nickmaccarthy/dotfiles
dotfiles_install: True

# Set the default shell to bash.  On recent version of OSX, this has been zsh.  I typically do all my scripting in bash, so I am overwriting here.
default_shell: bash

brew_base_items:
  - openssl
  - vim
  - git
  - wget
  - node

brew_cask_items:
  - docker
  - iterm2
  - vagrant
  - virtualbox

pip_items:
  - virtualenv

```

## Adding additional Applications / Programs

If you are satisfied with the default application/program list, but want to add a few more items, you can do so by adding you items to the `additional` item lists

Example:

```yaml
additional_brew_cask_items:
  - visual-studio-code
```

## Shell support

By default, this will install zsh and the powerlevel10k zsh theme.  zsh has just been easier to manage on modern macs vs bash, so I've switched over to using it.  At the time of this writing, I'm liking the powerlevel10k theme, so I'm installing it by default.  It installs enough to get you going, but if you run a `p10k configure`, it will not overwrite your future changes.

## M Series (M1) mac support

The times they are a changin'.  I have recently purchased a new M series Mac, and while running this playbook, I noticed homebrew, etc gets installed into a different directoy.  I have updated this playbook to account for M series systems and defined facts that should work between both M1 and Intel architectures. If you run into any issues, let me know by opening an issue.
